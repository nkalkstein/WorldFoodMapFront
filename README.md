# World Food Map

A map-based application for food and travel lovers, where users can explore the food culture of virtually any city in the world.

Use an interactive world map to choose a city and view fun food and travel videos from that chosen location

Create personalized favorites list with videos you liked from various cities around the world

# Motivation

As a food and travel lover who is not able to go on nearly as many trips as I'd like, youtube offers a huge selection of high quality food and travel videos.  

This app is something that I would use if someone else made it, so I decided to make it myself.
