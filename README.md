# World Food Map

A map-based application for food, cooking and travel lovers, where users can explore the food culture of virtually any city in the world.

Use an interactive world map to choose a city and view fun food and travel videos from that chosen location.

Create personalized favorites list with videos you liked from various cities around the world.

# Motivation

As a food and travel lover who is not able to go on nearly as many trips as I'd like, YouTube offers a huge selection of high quality food and travel videos.  

In order to learn about a place, however, you have to know that it exists.  With the World Food Map you can learn about far away places whose names you've never heard of, but where you can explore nonetheless.

I had long thought about how fun and useful a map-based food video application would be.  When I couldn\ not find anything like it, I decided to make it myself!
