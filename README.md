# World Food Map

A map-based application for food, cooking and travel lovers, where users can explore the food culture of virtually any city in the world.

Use an interactive world map or browse by continent to choose a city and view amazing food and cooking videos from that chosen location.

Learn about the cuisines of the world, from the national, to the regional, to the local, and everywhere in between, the varieties and

Create personalized favorites list with videos you liked from cities around the world.

# Motivation

As a food and travel lover who is not able to go on nearly as many trips as I'd like, YouTube offers a huge selection of high quality food and travel videos.  

In order to learn about a place, however, you have to know that it exists.  With the World Food Map you can learn about far away places whose names you've never heard of, but where you can explore nonetheless.

I had long thought about how fun and useful a map-based food video application would be.  When I could not find anything like it, I decided to make it myself!
